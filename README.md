# GettingAndCleaningData
Coursera Week 4 assignment

This repo contains:

- the CodeBook with describes the data used, how it was transformed, and information for the variables
included in the data.
- the run_analysis.R which takes the data that has been downloaded to the working directory, transforms
the imported data to a tidy data set, and outputs a file containing the final tidy data set named "finalTidyData.txt".
